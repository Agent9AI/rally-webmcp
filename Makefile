Use primary Google sources only. For every included launch, show the release date, what changed, who it matters to, a concrete business use, and a source URL. Include an executive synthesis, a coverage appendix grouped by product family, and a machine-readable claim ledger. Do not guess: unsupported or disputed claims must be omitted or labeled. Add automated checks for required sections, dates, source URLs, and local presentation loading. Every factual claim and the finished presentation must be independently verified."
