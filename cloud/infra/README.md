# Rally Google Cloud infrastructure

Terraform owns two deliberately separate Cloud Run services, their
least-privilege service accounts, Firestore, Artifact Registry, Secret Manager,
Cloud KMS, API enablement, and narrowly scoped invoker grants.

The coordinator is not public. The local bridge impersonates a dedicated
`rally-local-invoker` service account to mint a short-lived, service-audience ID
token. Only `imterryim@gmail.com` may impersonate it, and the caller must also
present the independent `X-Rally-Service-Token` application credential. Prompt
and response bodies are excluded from telemetry.

The optional `rally-control-plane` service is public only at the network edge.
Every customer route verifies either a Google Identity Services ID token or a
hashed, short-lived Rally browser session and never receives permission to
invoke the private coordinator. Google redirect sign-in uses an exact
same-origin callback, double-submit CSRF validation, and a two-minute one-use
exchange code. Allowlisted company-email sign-in uses a signed, ten-minute,
one-use link delivered by Resend. Both paths issue the same 30-minute session;
Firestore stores hashes rather than raw link, code, or session values and TTL
cleans expired records. Connector credentials are encrypted with a new
AES-256-GCM data key per connection; Cloud KMS wraps each data key, while
Firestore stores only ciphertext and metadata.

Deployment is deliberately gated and two-phase so Cloud Run never references an
image before its Terraform-managed registry exists. After tests and ADK
evaluations pass:

1. Apply the default bootstrap plan with a non-used placeholder `image_uri`.
   `deploy_service` defaults to false, so this creates the registry, APIs,
   identity, Firestore, IAM, and secret—but not Cloud Run.
2. Build and push a commit-addressed candidate to the new repository, then
   resolve its registry digest.
3. Apply the reviewed production plan with both Cloud Run services enabled and
   both image URIs pinned by digest.
4. Run the sensitive `local_token_install_command` output locally.
5. Put Terraform's `service_url` into Rally's `google_cloud.url`, enable the
   integration, and run `./bin/rally --check --smoke`.

## Customer control plane activation

Company-email sign-in and hosted run authority require pre-created Secret
Manager secrets named `rally-resend-api-key`, `rally-magic-link-signing-key`,
and `rally-run-authority-signing-key`. Both signing values must be
cryptographically random and at least 32 bytes. Grant only the
`rally-control-plane` service account `roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor` on
those three secrets. Terraform manages those narrow IAM memberships, reads the
existing secret metadata, and mounts `latest`; it does not create a secret or
place a payload in state. The sender
defaults to `Rally <rally@updates.agent9.dev>` and must be verified in Resend.
Keep each approved company address in `control_plane_allowed_user_emails`.

Terraform also creates the ten-minute-retention `rally-magic-link-delivery`
Pub/Sub topic and push subscription. The control plane may publish; Pub/Sub may
mint an OIDC token as that service account; and the internal delivery route
requires the exact configured service-account email and audience. The request
path queues approved and unknown addresses alike to avoid an allowlist timing
oracle. Unknown deliveries are acknowledged without sending. The queued message
contains no usable login token: the authenticated delivery worker derives one,
keeps it pending until Resend accepts the message, then activates it in
Firestore.

The run-authority key signs deny-by-default, per-run connector grants returned
to the authenticated Worker. Create its first enabled version before enabling
the hosted control plane; otherwise Terraform and the control-plane revision
fail closed. Never reuse either login-signing material or a provider credential
as this key.

Google requires Web OAuth client registration in Cloud Console. Create a Web
application client named `Rally Web` and authorize the JavaScript origin
`https://rally.agent9.dev`. Also authorize the exact redirect URI
`https://rally.agent9.dev/admin/google/callback` for privacy-browser fallback.

The Google Workspace connector deliberately uses a second confidential OAuth
client rather than the public sign-in client. It is not enabled in this release:
keep `google_workspace_client_id=""`, and the hosted card remains unavailable.
For a future release, register its exact redirect as
`https://rally.agent9.dev/admin/connect/callback`, then add the client secret
directly to Secret Manager without placing it in Terraform state or this repo:

```bash
gcloud secrets versions add rally-google-workspace-oauth-client-secret \
  --project=rally-agent9-2026 --data-file=-
```

Set `google_workspace_client_id` only after that secret version exists and the
connector flow has passed release testing. Rally keeps the Workspace card
unavailable until both values are present in the control plane. Google Sign-In
itself needs only the separate Rally Web public client ID; Rally does not use or
store an OAuth client secret for sign-in.

After the candidate image exists, resolve its digest, then review and apply a
plan that preserves the private coordinator and enables the separate control
plane:

```bash
terraform -chdir=cloud/infra plan -out=/tmp/rally-production.tfplan \
  -var='deploy_service=true' \
  -var='deploy_control_plane=true' \
  -var='image_uri=us-east1-docker.pkg.dev/rally-agent9-2026/rally/rally-google-coordinator@sha256:<proven-coordinator-digest>' \
  -var='control_plane_image_uri=us-east1-docker.pkg.dev/rally-agent9-2026/rally/rally-google-coordinator@sha256:<control-plane-digest>' \
  -var='google_web_client_id=<public-client-id>' \
  -var='google_workspace_client_id=""' \
  -var='control_plane_allowed_origins=["https://rally.agent9.dev"]' \
  -var='control_plane_allowed_user_emails=["imterryim@gmail.com","terry@agent9.dev"]'

terraform -chdir=cloud/infra apply /tmp/rally-production.tfplan
```

The separate image variables prevent a control-plane release from silently
replacing the private coordinator revision. If both services intentionally use
the same digest-pinned image, `control_plane_image_uri` may be omitted.

Use an initial email allowlist for the first operator test. Put Terraform's
`control_plane_url` and the same public client ID in `site/admin/config.js`, run
the release gate, and then deploy the static site. Never commit provider keys,
Google ID tokens, Terraform state, or KMS plaintext.

Never commit Terraform state, a service token, an identity token, or an eval
result containing model thoughts.
