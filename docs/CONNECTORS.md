# Connector gateway

Rally exposes one MCP server to every worker: `rally-connectors`. The gateway is
not a bag of credentials. It is a run-scoped policy boundary between a model and
each customer system.

Rally implements ten deny-by-default runtime adapters. The hosted admin catalog
at `/admin/` exposes nine supported systems: Google Workspace, Slack, GitHub,
Cloudflare Observability, n8n Cloud, Stripe, Atlassian, Salesforce, and
HyperAgent. BigQuery is the tenth runtime adapter; it uses operator-owned Google
Application Default Credentials (ADC), is configured separately, and is not a
hosted catalog card. **Supported**, **catalogued**, and **adapter implemented**
do not mean connected or certified. A customer connection becomes usable only
after these gates pass:

1. the user supplies their own Google ADC, provider OAuth grant, or restricted
   credential through the connector's documented path;
2. bounded live MCP discovery answers from the pinned provider endpoint;
3. the discovered tools match the connector's committed safe allowlist;
4. one predetermined, harmless read-only canary succeeds and Rally stores only
   its content-free proof; and
5. every worker receives the same immutable authority snapshot for the run.

Everything else defaults to deny. Retrieved connector content is untrusted
input. Arguments and results are hashed into receipts; their content is not
copied into the receipt log. Provider endpoints are HTTPS- and hostname-pinned,
redirects are refused, discovery is bounded to 128 tools/512 KiB, arguments to
256 KiB, and returned model-visible data to 1 MiB. Per-tool policy may narrow
those ceilings and constrain exact resource IDs before a network call.

The gateway ships named provider-safe presets. A preset is an exact tool
allowlist with smaller payload bounds; it is not a wildcard and never follows
future provider catalog growth automatically.

## Hosted activation

The Google-authenticated admin at `/admin/` is the front door for the nine-card
hosted catalog. Google Workspace, Slack, and Salesforce currently stay disabled
and say “Not available yet” until their required Rally-owned or provider app
registration is complete. GitHub has a guided fine-grained-token path.
Cloudflare Observability, n8n Cloud, Stripe, Atlassian, and HyperAgent expose an
implemented OAuth Authorization Code with PKCE and/or restricted-credential
path only where the control plane declares activation available. OAuth metadata
and token endpoints are restricted to provider-owned hosts. A visible
**Connect** action means the activation path is enabled; it is not evidence that
a customer account is connected or certified. No card sends a nontechnical user
to a provider console and calls that a connection.

Every dashboard commission receives a signed, deny-by-default hosted run
authority bound to its run ID, requester UID, and workspace. The local runner
freezes only the certified tool manifests in that record and reaches the hosted
relay with an audience-bound runner identity. Retries must present the identical
authority; added, removed, changed, expired, or noncanonical grants fail closed.
Ruflo research may be combined with this connector snapshot, but it cannot read
connector credentials or widen the certified tools.

The registered production callback at `rally.agent9.dev` is handled by the
Cloudflare Worker. Starting consent sets a ten-minute, per-flow `HttpOnly`,
`Secure`, `SameSite=Lax` browser-binding cookie. On return, the Worker matches
that cookie to the one-use state, relays only bounded callback fields to the
control plane, and clears the cookie before returning the browser to the
originating card. The admin page receives neither the authorization code nor a
provider token. There is no less-secure static callback fallback; an unavailable
Worker makes authorization fail closed. Google Workspace additionally requires
a separate confidential connector client. That client is not the Google
Identity Services web client used to sign into Rally.

The admin keeps its identity token, short-lived Rally session, and any pasted
credential only in page memory; it does not save those values to cookies, local
storage, or session storage. The only Rally cookie in connector consent is the
opaque, short-lived browser binding above; it contains no identity or provider
credential and page JavaScript cannot read it. A provider authorization code
necessarily reaches the callback URL, and Rally's one-time session-restoration
code briefly appears in a URL fragment; both are single-use and removed from the
visible URL. Signing out requests deletion of the server-side session hash and
clears page memory. If that request cannot complete, the 30-minute expiry remains
the backstop. Google Cloud KMS envelope-encrypts provider tokens in the
user-owned vault.
“Ready” is emitted only after authentication, allowlist-matched discovery, and
the connector's fixed harmless live read succeed. The proof contains the canary
name, input-schema digest, time, and approved-tool count—not its returned
business content. A credential or tool list alone is never Ready.

The hosted vault is an activation bridge, not autonomous model authority. A
signed-in administrator can invoke only a Certified, preset-allowlisted read
tool through the hosted control plane; each call rechecks tenant ownership,
readiness, arguments, and policy and writes a content-free receipt. Agent runs
additionally require a separate immutable, user-bound authority snapshot.

On disconnect, Rally disables the connector before any network call. For OAuth,
it uses a published revocation endpoint before deleting its encrypted copy; a
failed automatic revocation leaves that copy sealed for retry. When no automatic
revocation exists, Rally deletes its copy and reports that provider action is
still required. A manually supplied key or token must be revoked in provider
settings. This contract defines what can qualify as Ready. It is not a claim
that every catalogued provider has passed live production certification.

## Per-user isolation

A connection belongs to one commissioner, never to the Rally installation.
Rally normalizes the commissioner identity and stores only a one-way profile key
such as `p-a8…` in the ignored local policy file. Each OAuth provider gets a
profile-specific macOS Keychain namespace. At commission time, the authenticated
sender selects exactly one profile; its enabled connectors and tool policies are
frozen into the run. Another user cannot inherit that authority.

For direct CLI work, select the same boundary explicitly:

```bash
./bin/rally --as-user person@company.com --run "Prepare the account review"
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com list
```

Codex uses the same run snapshot. It starts with `--ignore-user-config`, so an
unrelated MCP server from the user's global Codex configuration cannot bypass
Rally's gateway. Claude receives a strict per-run MCP file; Antigravity must have
the Rally gateway as its only enabled MCP server.

## Runtime-connector setup

First register the single Rally gateway with Antigravity:

```bash
./bin/rally connectors install
agy mcp list
```

Antigravity's MCP configuration is global. Before enabling a Rally connector,
disable every other enabled MCP server for this worker profile. Rally preflight
will refuse to run if a model could bypass the gateway.

### Google Workspace

Workspace is one Rally product card backed by eight official, pinned Google MCP
services: Gmail, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides, Calendar, Chat, and People. Rally
opens and checks each service independently, qualifies discovered tools by
service (`gmail.search_threads`, `drive.search_files`, and so on), and dispatches
each call only to that service. Every service must expose at least one tool from
the committed allowlist. Fixed, resource-free live reads prove Gmail, Drive,
Calendar, Chat, and People; returned content is discarded after the content-free
proof is computed. Docs, Sheets, and Slides require user-owned resource IDs, so
discovery alone never places their tools in the certified manifest. A discovery
or canary failure fails the aggregate card closed.

The read-minimal preset requests 15 read-only Google scopes and contains no
draft, send, share, create, update, or delete tool. The connector uses a
confidential Workspace OAuth client owned by Rally. It is a separate credential
and consent grant from the Google Identity Services client that signs an
administrator into Rally.

```bash
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com register-client google-workspace
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com enable google-workspace \
  --preset read-minimal
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com auth google-workspace
```

For the local runtime path above, an operator must enable the eight Workspace MCP
services, configure a connector OAuth client, and register Rally's local callback
URI; the registration and user token stay in that profile's macOS Keychain
namespace. For hosted onboarding, Rally owns that confidential registration.
Until its client ID and secret are deployed, the Workspace card stays disabled
instead of sending the customer to Google Cloud Console. This section describes
the admission contract and does not assert a live hosted Workspace
certification.

### Slack

Slack requires a confidential OAuth client belonging to an internal app or a
Marketplace app; Slack prohibits unlisted apps from using its MCP server. The
initial Rally preset requests only public search, file/channel reads, and user
lookup scopes—no private-message search or mutation scope.

```bash
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com register-client slack
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com enable slack \
  --preset read-minimal
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com auth slack
```

### GitHub

GitHub's remote MCP server requires a token obtained by Rally's host application;
the server does not perform OAuth itself. Import a dedicated GitHub App/OAuth
token or fine-grained PAT, then use the fixed read-only preset:

```bash
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com import-token github
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com enable github \
  --preset read-only
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com doctor github
```

Every GitHub request carries provider-enforced read-only and lockdown headers
plus the pinned `context`, `repos`, `issues`, `pull_requests`, and `users`
toolsets. A local policy edit cannot weaken those headers.

### Cloudflare Observability

Rally starts with Cloudflare's narrow Observability MCP server rather than the
broad API server whose `execute` tool can perform reads or writes. Authenticate,
review the live schemas, and allow only the three read-oriented tools:

```bash
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com auth cloudflare
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com enable cloudflare \
  --preset observability
```

The pinned endpoint is `https://observability.mcp.cloudflare.com/mcp`. The
general Cloudflare API MCP server remains outside this preset until Rally can
classify the underlying API method, not merely the wrapper tool name.

### n8n Cloud

Rally accepts only the tenant-scoped HTTPS endpoint
`https://<tenant>.app.n8n.cloud/mcp-server/http`. Arbitrary self-hosted URLs are
not accepted through this adapter. n8n exposes workflows at the user level, so
administrators must keep automatic exposure off and bind each allowed tool call
to explicit workflow IDs using Rally's argument constraints. n8n currently
defaults automatic exposure to off; Rally does not rely on that default as the
enforcement boundary.

```bash
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com enable n8n \
  --endpoint 'https://YOUR-TENANT.app.n8n.cloud/mcp-server/http' \
  --preset workflow-bounded \
  --workflow-id 'EXACT-WORKFLOW-ID'
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com auth n8n
```

Discovery alone grants no execution. `execute_workflow` belongs behind human
approval; search, creation, editing, publishing, archiving, agent mutation, and
data-table writes remain denied by default.

### Stripe

Stripe's pinned hosted endpoint supports OAuth 2.1 with dynamic registration:

```bash
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com auth stripe
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com enable stripe \
  --preset read-minimal
```

Broad customer/financial reads, writes, refunds, reports, feedback submission,
and money movement are not part of the minimal preset. Sandbox and live Stripe
connections must be authorized and reviewed separately.

### BigQuery (runtime only; not a hosted catalog card)

BigQuery is available through the CLI/runtime registry but is not one of the
nine systems exposed by the hosted admin or hosted connector API. It may use the
local OS user's Application Default Credentials identity—no API key or Rally
token file. A non-local commissioner profile must name its own ADC credential
file; Rally refuses to fall back to the machine-wide identity.

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login
./bin/rally connectors --profile local doctor bigquery
```

The identity needs `roles/mcp.toolUser` plus the minimum BigQuery permissions
for the chosen job. Google's read-oriented starting point is
`roles/bigquery.jobUser` and `roles/bigquery.dataViewer`; narrow dataset access
further where possible. The first live doctor check on 2026-08-29 negotiated
MCP successfully and returned six tools. The built-in starting preset is
narrower: four metadata tools and no SQL execution surface.

```bash
./bin/rally connectors enable bigquery \
  --preset metadata-only
```

An administrator can later add `execute_sql_readonly=read` with explicit
project/dataset constraints. The broader `execute_sql` remains denied unless a
separate gated policy is deliberately configured.

For a separate commissioner profile, stage that user's ADC file and include
`--profile person@company.com --credential-file /private/path/to/adc.json` on
the `enable` command. The ignored policy stores only the path; the credential
file itself must remain private and outside the repository.

### Atlassian

```bash
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com auth atlassian
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com enable atlassian \
  --preset read-minimal
```

The first command performs OAuth 2.1 in the browser, stores OAuth state in the
profile-specific macOS Keychain service, and proves live Jira,
Confluence, or Compass tool discovery. Grant only the sites and products needed
for the demo.

### Salesforce

Salesforce's read-only hosted SObject MCP server is selected explicitly. Create
and activate a Salesforce External Client App, store its consumer key (and
secret when required), then authenticate and discover tools:

```bash
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com register-client salesforce \
  --public-client
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com enable salesforce \
  --endpoint 'https://api.salesforce.com/platform/mcp/v1/platform/sobject-reads' \
  --preset sobject-reads
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com auth salesforce
```

OAuth state is stored in that user's namespaced Keychain service. Do not
commit tenant URLs if the organization treats them as private; the ignored
`config/connectors.local.json` holds local endpoint and allowlist settings.

### Hyperagent

Hyperagent publishes a hosted remote MCP server at
`https://hyperagent.com/api/mcp`. Each Rally user completes Hyperagent's
one-time browser OAuth flow; Rally keeps that token in the user's namespaced
Keychain service. The documented surface can list the user's agents and
threads, start a background thread, follow up, upload an attachment, and poll
for the result.

Authenticate first, inspect the live tool schemas, then enable the read-only
surface. Starting or continuing external work belongs behind Rally's exact,
single-use human approval gate:

```bash
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com auth hyperagent
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com enable hyperagent \
  --preset read-minimal
```

`resolve_approval` is never autonomous. The person must inspect and approve the
exact pending Hyperagent action; Rally then consumes that approval once.

For an explicitly allowlisted `human_approval` tool, the first call creates a
private, expiring request and returns its content-free ID. The administrator can
inspect and approve that exact call:

```bash
./bin/rally connectors approvals runs/RUN-ID --status pending
./bin/rally connectors review runs/RUN-ID APPROVAL-ID
./bin/rally connectors approve runs/RUN-ID APPROVAL-ID --as human-operator
```

The agent retries with that approval ID. Rally binds it to the run, connector,
tool, and complete argument digest, then consumes it before the network call;
reuse, argument substitution, expiry, and concurrent replay fail closed.

This connection is distinct from Hyperagent's optional ChatGPT subscription
connection. Rally authorizes the user's Hyperagent MCP account; it never
receives or brokers the user's ChatGPT entitlement through Hyperagent.

## Verify before a live run

The CLI registry below covers all ten runtime adapters. The hosted admin/API
covers the nine-card catalog named under **Hosted activation**; the BigQuery
doctor check exercises its separate ADC runtime path.

```bash
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com list
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com doctor bigquery
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com doctor cloudflare
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com doctor stripe
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com doctor atlassian
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com doctor salesforce
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com doctor hyperagent
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com doctor google-workspace
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com doctor slack
./bin/rally connectors --profile person@company.com doctor github
./bin/rally --check
make test
make cloud-test
```

`doctor` is runtime-gateway evidence: it authenticates, initializes an MCP
session, and lists the tools the provider actually returned. It is not the
hosted-card certification by itself. Hosted certification additionally requires
the discovered surface to match the committed allowlist and one fixed harmless
read to return successfully; its proof stores metadata and digests, never the
returned content. An enabled connector with zero read tools remains
discovery-only. `human_approval` tools use the shipped exact, expiring, one-time
approval ledger. `verify_first` continues to fail closed until an independent
pre-execution verifier is selected; it is never treated as post-hoc review.

## Run receipts

The hosted connection proof and a run receipt answer different questions. The
connection proof says that one user's sealed credential reached an allowlisted
provider surface and completed its fixed harmless read. It does not authorize a
run. The run receipt records what the execution gateway later permitted under a
separate immutable authority snapshot.

Every run freezes its connector authority into
`runs/<run-id>/connector-authority.json`. Allowed, denied, and failed calls append
to `connector-receipts.jsonl` with actor, connector, tool, risk, decision,
duration, and SHA-256 hashes of arguments/results. The snapshot names only the
one-way credential-profile key. OAuth tokens, user email addresses, tool
arguments, and returned business data are excluded.
