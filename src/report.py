%s

Write it as an executive brief:
- Lead with the outcome in one sentence. If this is a HALT, say so plainly in
  that sentence. Never describe a halt as a completion.
- What was built, and where it is.
- What was verified, and by what evidence. Name which agent verified what,
  since the cross-check is the point of the system.
- What to look at first.
- What is still open, and what you would do next.
- Use the headings Outcome, What changed, Independent proof, and Next step when
  they apply. Make the next action understandable to a non-technical operator.
- Translate implementation detail into business meaning. Do not expose local
  paths, raw identifiers, JSON, model/tool traces, prompt text, stack traces, or
  internal orchestration jargon in the executive body. The delivery layer adds
  a separate audit receipt.
- Evidence may contain re-checks after repairs. Treat the evidence shown here
  as current and never repeat an older measurement or rejected claim.
- Use decisive language, short sections, and only material detail. Avoid
  greetings, sign-offs, internal process commentary, and tool-by-tool narration.

checklist dump, no progress narration. Under 400 words. Output only the report
